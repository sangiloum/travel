Now, you are within 8km from the IBS Discrete Mathematics Group. 

It is recommended for you to take a taxi to IBS. The taxi fare should be around 10,000 KRW and it will take about 20 minutes.

#### Taxi
Here's the instruction to give to the taxi driver. Often taxi drivers do not know IBS but all of them are familiar with the big department store next to the IBS --- Shinsegae Department Store, the tallest building of Daejeon.

#### Subway + Taxi

Go out the front of the train-based Daejeon Station aboveground building and go underground into the subway-based Daejeon Station. Go down the escalator, make several lefts, go down another escalator, and use your transit card (T-money) or purchase a single use token. Walk 15 steps, turn left, go down the escalator, and go to the platform on your left. Trains come every 10 minutes or so. In fifteen minutes you’ll travel eight stations, exit at Government Complex, Daejeon Station (정부청사 pronounced Jeongbu Chongsa), and go out Exit 3 or 4 and hop into a taxi. The ride is about 7 minutes, which will cost around 6,500 KRW. However, it is currently not possible to turn left from the main east-west road directly into the IBS entrance. Drivers will either need to go near the Daejeon Convention Center and then do a U-turn, or turn right past Studio Cube and then approach IBS from the West gate.

#### Bus
Although time-consuming, it is possible to reach IBS by bus. Depending on traffic, the bus ride will take more than 1 hour and cost KRW 1,500 with T-money card. Once arriving at Daejeon Station, go out the front entrance (Exit 1) and walk until you reach the street. Turn right and walk another 60 meters until you reach a bus top. Ride bus 606 or 707 and exit the bus 
at the Shinsegae Department Store (신세계백화점). As the buses have different routes after crossing the river. Regardless of the bus, exit as soon as you go over the bridge and be prepared for a walk less than 900m.
