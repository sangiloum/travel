{: .note}
If you want to exchange currencies, Seoul Station has a few official current exchange offices, and the rates are much better than at the airport. Their sell-rate and buy-rate do not differ a lot.


From Seoul Station, you can take trains to Daejeon Station.
Tickets for trains can be purchased by tellers at ticketing counters, by machine, or online at
- [Korail Website (English)](https://www.letskorail.com/english)
- [Mobile Korail Website (English)](https://m.letskorail.com/english)

For visitors from China, it is also possible to buy the train ticket on [WeChat](https://www.minipaycn.com/minipay/wechat.do) or [AliPay](https://www.minipaycn.com/minipay/alipay.do).

As of 2023, it is possible to buy tickets online at above website by using foreign credit cards.

The ticketing counter closest to the AREX entrance is smaller and typically has a smaller line than the ticketing counter close to the main street entrance. Ticketing machines are located in between the two sets of counters and are closer to the street entrance than the AREX entrance.

#### KTX Trains
The KTX is a high-speed train that travels at speeds of up to 305 km/h.
KTX standard seats cost **KRW 23,700** and first class seats costs KRW 33,200 and are sometimes discounted. Travel time is roughly **one hour** depending on the number of stops in route. Tickets do occasionally sell out but trains run every 10 to 20 minutes. Please see the website above for current timetables. Train types other than KTX exist but take two hours to travel to Daejeon and do not run as often.

{: .warning}
Often KTX tickets on Friday evening, Saturday morning, and Sunday evening are sold out. If you are traveling on these days, it is recommended to buy tickets in advance. 

{: .note}
Some KTX trains are slower as they use a slower track to visit Suwon. If you are in a hurry, make sure to check the timetable and choose the train that does not stop at Suwon. Those KTX trains are cheaper.

#### Slower trains
There are slower trains that take two hours to travel to Daejeon. 
- Available train types: ITX, Mugunghwa (무궁화)

These trains are cheaper than the KTX, from KRW 10,800 (Mugunghwa) to KRW 16,000 (ITX).
