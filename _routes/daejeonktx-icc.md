#### Subway + Taxi

Go out the front of the train-based Daejeon Station aboveground building and go underground into the subway-based Daejeon Station. Go down the escalator, make several lefts, go down another escalator, and use your transit card (T-money) or purchase a single use token. Walk 15 steps, turn left, go down the escalator, and go to the platform on your left. Trains come every 10 minutes or so. In fifteen minutes you’ll travel eight stations, exit at Government Complex, Daejeon Station (정부청사 pronounced Jeongbu Chongsa), and go out Exit 3 or 4 and hop into a taxi. The ride is less than 10 minutes, which will cost around 6,500 KRW. 

#### Bus

Although time-consuming, it is possible to reach the I-Hotel by bus. Depending on traffic, the bus ride will take more than 1 hour and cost KRW 1,500 with T-money card. Once arriving at Daejeon Station, go out the front entrance (Exit 1) and walk until you reach the street. Turn right and walk another 60 meters until you reach a bus top. Ride bus 707 and exit the bus at its last station, called the DCC last station(DCC종점). From there, you can walk 200m to the ICC Hotel.
