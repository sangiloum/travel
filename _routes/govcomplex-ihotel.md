Now, you are within 3km from the [I-Hotel](https://www.i-hotel.co.kr).

After you arrive at the [Government Complex Bus Stop](https://naver.me/GlVC83eN), there should be taxis waiting for you. It is recommended for you to take a taxi to IBS. The taxi fare should be around 6,500 KRW and it should take less than 10 minutes.
