title: Use a subway to go to Seoul Station
order: 10
---

You can use the all-stop [AREX (Airport Express)](https://www.arex.or.kr/main.do) subway to go to Seoul Station from Gimpo International Airport. The Seoul Station is a major transportation hub in Seoul and you can take the KTX train to Daejeon from the Seoul Station.

All-stop trains take 22 minutes, cost KRW 1,600, leave roughly every 7 minutes, have seats like traditional subways, and ride until the last stop (Seoul Station). First train leaves at 5:43 AM and last train to the Seoul Station leaves at 00:16 AM.
Since the platform is deep underground, you will need extra 10 minutes in both Gimpo and Seoul Stations.
