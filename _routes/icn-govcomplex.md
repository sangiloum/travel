title: Using the Airport Bus to go to Daejeon directly
---
For most visitors, this is the most recommended method to visit IBS.
From the Incheon airport, you can take the airport bus to the Daejeon Government Complex. The bus will take you directly. The bus ride will take at most 3 hours.

Buy bus tickets at the inside ticket office between gate 8 and 9.
At the ticket office, you can purchase the ticket for Daejeon Government Complex (대전청사) Bus Stop. The prices are the same for all four stops in Daejeon (North Daejeon, Doryong, Government Complex, and Daejeon Bus Terminal). Although the Doryong (Daedukmunhwa center) is also close to IBS, there are not many taxis waiting at the stop.

Then, take the bus at gate 11.
