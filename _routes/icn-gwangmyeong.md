This may be the fastest way to get to Daejeon from the Incheon Airport and will be faster than going through the Seoul Station. This is because the KTX train from the Seoul Station to Daejeon goes through the KTX Gwangmyeong Station and the KTX Gwangmyeong Station is closer to the Incheon Airport than the Seoul Station.

The KTX Gwangmyeong Station is located in Gwangmyeong, a city in the Gyeonggi Province. The KTX Gwangmyeong Station is roughly 50 km away from the Incheon Airport.

You can use a bus number **6770** or **6004** to go to the KTX Gwangmyeong Station (KTX광명역) from Incheon International Airport. The bus stop is located at the 1st floor of the airport. 
You can buy bus tickets inside the airport near Exit 4 and in between 8 and 9; and outside just left of Exit 11.
You can also use the T-Money Card to pay for the bus fare in the bus.
