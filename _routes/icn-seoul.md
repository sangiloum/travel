If you prefer to take the train, you can take an [AREX (Airport Railroad Express)](https://www.arex.or.kr) train at Incheon International Airport Station across the street from Terminal 1. All stop AREX trains are to the east (your left) and non-stop express AREX trains are to the west (your right). 

Non-stop express trains take **43 minutes**, cost **KRW 11,000**, leave roughly every 40 minutes, have seats like traditional trains, and will take you directly to Seoul Station. 
Often, you can preorder tickets at the discount price of KRW 8,700 or less at various websites, such as [Klook](https://www.klook.com/en-US/activity/1163-airport-to-seoul-city-center-arex-train-incheon/).
The earliest train leaves at 5:23 AM and the last train leaves at 10:48 PM.
Typically there are plenty of seats available all the time.

All-stop trains take 59 minutes, cost KRW 4,950 including a refundable KRW 500 for a single journey ticket, leave roughly every 7 minutes, have seats like traditional subways, and ride until the last stop (Seoul Station). First train leaves at 5:24 AM and last train to the Seoul Station leaves at 11:38 PM.

{: .note}
Instead of a single journey ticket, you can buy a transportation card called the [T-money card](https://www.t-money.co.kr/ncs/pct/tmnyintd/ReadFrgnKoreaTourCardEngIntd.dev) at the airport and use it for the all-stop AREX train and other public transportation in Korea.

Timetables and updated information are available at [www.arex.or.kr](https://www.arex.or.kr).

After arriving at Seoul Station, follow the crowds up 1 small escalator, 1 long escalator, scan your transit card, if you have a single journey ticket then refund it in the separate refund machine, 2 more escalators, and now you are in the center of Seoul Station.
