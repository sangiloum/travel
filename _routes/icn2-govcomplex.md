{: .note}
The prices are the same for all four stops in Daejeon (North Daejeon, Daedeok Culture Center
     (Doryong), Government Complex, and Daejeon Bus Terminal). Although the Daedeok Culture Center is also close to IBS, there are not many taxis waiting at the stop. 
     If you don't mind walking with luggages, 
     then it is possible to get off at the Daedeok Culture Center (Doryong) stop and walk for 30 minutes to IBS.
     Otherwise it is difficult to get a taxi at this location and we recommend the Government Complex stop.

![Daejeon Government Complex (대전청사) Bus Stop](/assets/images/govcomplexstop.jpg)

Other than a very small sign, there is no written signage and this bus stop doesn't appear on many maps. Don't let that stop you as many people get off buses here; so many that there is always a queue of taxis waiting to pick up passengers.
