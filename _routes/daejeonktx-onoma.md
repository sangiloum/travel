#### Subway + Taxi

Go out the front of the train-based Daejeon Station aboveground building and go underground into the subway-based Daejeon Station. Go down the escalator, make several lefts, go down another escalator, and use your transit card (T-money) or purchase a single use token. Walk 15 steps, turn left, go down the escalator, and go to the platform on your left. Trains come every 10 minutes or so. In fifteen minutes you’ll travel eight stations, exit at Government Complex, Daejeon Station (정부청사 pronounced Jeongbu Chongsa), and go out Exit 3 or 4 and hop into a taxi. The ride is about 7 minutes, which will cost around 6,500 KRW. 

#### Bus

Although time-consuming, it is possible to reach the Onoma Hotel by bus. Depending on traffic, the bus ride will take more than 1 hour and cost KRW 1,500 with T-money card. Once arriving at Daejeon Station, go out the front entrance (Exit 1) and walk until you reach the street. Turn right and walk another 60 meters until you reach a bus top. Ride bus 606 or 707 and exit the bus 
at the Shinsegae Department Store (신세계백화점). As the buses have different routes after crossing the river. Regardless of the bus, exit as soon as you go over the bridge and be prepared for a walk less than 900m.
