Now, you are within 3km from the IBS Guesthouse/Dormitory. 

After you arrive at the [Government Complex Bus Stop](https://naver.me/GlVC83eN), there should be taxis waiting for you. It is recommended for you to take a taxi to IBS. The taxi fare should be around 6,000 KRW and it should take less than 10 minutes.


Here's the instruction to give to the taxi driver. Often taxi drivers do not know IBS but all of them are familiar with the big department store next to the IBS --- Shinsegae Department Store, the tallest building of Daejeon.
